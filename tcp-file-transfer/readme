*  Problem description
*******************************************************

Write a client/server program with the socket interface.
The client program may send out the words to the server
once the user presses "Enter" and the server will respond
to these words with any meaningless terms. However, the
server will close the connection once it receives the word
"Bye". Also, once someone keys in "GivemeyourVideo", the 
server will immediately send out a 50 MB data file with 
message size of 500 bytes. Calculate and record the data
transmission rate every 0.1 second for a 50 MB data
transmission with message size of 500 bytes. Use xgraph
and gnuplot to display the results.

*******************************************************
*  Source files
*******************************************************

Name:  client.c
   Client side.

Name: server.c
   Server side.

*******************************************************
*  Circumstances of programs
*******************************************************

   This program works and runs as intended.

   The test input video file must be named as "demo.mp4".
   (I know it looks hard-coded because of shortage of time.
   Might change the code to configure file names from the
   command line in future). Also, make sure to have gnuplot
   installed.
  
   The program was tested on :
	gcc version: 10.1.0
   gnuplot 5.2 patchlevel 8

*******************************************************
*  How to build and run the program
*******************************************************

1. Run the server side (from another terminal window):
   gcc server.c -o server
   ./server

2. Run the client side (from another terminal window):
   gcc client.c -o client
   ./client

3. Send messages from the client to the server by typing anything
   and pressing Enter. The server sends back a random string. If
   you specifically send "GivemeyourVideo", the server sends back
   a video in chunks of 500 bytes size and the client bundles up
   all the chunks and saves it as "output.mp4".

4. When the video is sent, the rate at which the chunks are sent
   is recorded and plotted using gnuplot.
